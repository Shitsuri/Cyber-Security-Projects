Key Concepts
1. What is a Network Packet?

    A network packet is a small unit of data transmitted over a network.
    It consists of three parts:
        Header: Contains metadata, such as source/destination IP addresses, protocol, and port numbers.
        Payload: The actual data being transmitted.
        Trailer: Optional; often used for error detection.

2. Why Analyze Packets?

    Troubleshooting: Identify connectivity or latency issues.
    Security: Detect suspicious or malicious activities like intrusions or data breaches.
    Performance: Optimize network bandwidth and application behavior.

3. Packet Analysis Tools

Common tools include:

    Wireshark: A widely used GUI-based tool for detailed packet inspection.
    tcpdump: A command-line tool for capturing network packets.
    ngrep: A utility for analyzing packets with pattern matching.
    Snort/Suricata: Intrusion detection systems (IDS) that analyze packet data for security threats.
